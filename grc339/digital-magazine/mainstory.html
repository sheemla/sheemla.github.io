            <h2>How is ice cream made?</h2>
            <p>Milk accounts for over 70% of the ingredients in ice cream, while mixtures often include natural additives such as sugar and fruit. Stabilizers, flavors, colorants, and emulsifiers in small amounts can also be added to improve flavor, texture, and appearance. Because ice cream is naturally kept by freezing, there are no added preservatives. To achieve its smoothness, the liquid is whipped and mixed as it freezes.</p>
            <p>When you freeze a container of milk or cream, you get a rigid block of frozen liquid rather than the soft, creamy ice cream we're used to. Ice cream is made using special procedures that produce smaller ice crystals and integrate air, resulting in a smooth texture. Ice cream that is constantly churned, whether by hand or mechanically, prevents the formation of huge, rigid ice crystals in the mixture. The churning operation also introduces air and creates a foamy texture, softening the mixture even further. There are, however, no-churn ice cream options.</p>

            <p>The majority of ice cream is created with heavy cream and eggs. It tastes great, but it's not the healthiest option. Using milk instead of cream might be a nice and healthy option. Try ice cream made with sweetened condensed milk for something a little fuller. You can even make ice cream with coconut milk if you want vegan options. Any amount of fat in the milk will suffice, whether it's fat-free, 2%, or full fat. You can also try making chocolate ice cream using chocolate milk.</p>

            <p>In a medium mixing basin, combine the milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, measure out each ingredient. Toss the ingredients together with a big spoon. Continue to whisk until the sugar has completely dissolved.</p>
