            <h2>How is ice cream made?</h2>
            <p>About 70% of the ingredients in ice cream come from milk, although mixes often contain natural ingredients like sugar and fruit. Small quantities of stabilisers, flavours, colourings and emulsifiers may also be added to enhance flavour, texture or appearance. There are no added preservatives as ice cream is preserved naturally by freezing. As it freezes, the mixture is whipped and blended to give its smoothness.</p>
            <p>If you place a container of milk or cream in the freezer, you'll end up with a stiff block of frozen liquid, not the soft, creamy ice cream that we're used to. Special techniques are employed to make ice cream that creates smaller ice crystals and incorporates air, which produces a soft texture. Constantly churning ice cream, whether by hand or mechanically, ensures that large, stiff ice crystals do not form within the mixture. The churning process also serves to introduce air and create a foam-like texture, further softening the mixture. However, there are no-churn options to make ice cream.</p>

            <p>Most ice cream is made with lots of heavy cream and eggs. It tastes delicious but it’s not very health-conscious. Using milk can be a tasty and healthier alternative to traditional cream. For something a little richer, try an ice cream made with sweetened condensed milk. If you prefer vegan options, you can even make ice cream with coconut milk. For the milk, any level of fat will do, whether it’s fat-free, 2% or full fat. You can also experiment with chocolate milk to create chocolate ice cream.</p>

            <p>Combine milk, sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Measure out each ingredient and add it to a medium-sized bowl. Use a large spoon to stir the ingredients together. Continue stirring until all of the sugar has dissolved.</p>
