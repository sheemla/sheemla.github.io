         <h1>Our Story</h1>
         <p>Audrey's Patisserie was born out of her love for sharing her wonderful baked goods and desserts with her friends and family. Her college roommate especially encouraged her to attend culinary school and open her own business because of her extraordinary talents. The menu is a compilation of Audrey's and her friends' favorite desserts and drinks.</p>
